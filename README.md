# iPhone-Alarm-Clone-LocalNotification

In this Project I implemented Local Notification Concepts
which includes

- Asking for Permission
- Checking for Permission
- Adding Local Notification
- Removing Local Notification using Identifier
- Printing All Pending Notifications
- Removing All Pending Notifications

This App UI is very Similar to IPhone Original App, supports Dark Mode as well
Where we can perform some operations like

- Add an Alarm
- Label an Alarm
- Add Alarm for specific Days
- Snooze Feature
